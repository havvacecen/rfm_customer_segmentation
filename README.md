## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze FLO customer data collected from both online and offline channels (OmniChannel) between 2020 and 2021. Using **RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)**, customers are grouped into meaningful segments for targeted marketing.

Key points:

- Analyze purchase behaviors to identify different customer segments.
- Score customers based on their purchasing recency, frequency, and monetary value.
- Assign customers to segments such as champions, loyal customers, at risk, etc.
- Identify special customer groups for specific marketing campaigns.
