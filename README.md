# 👟 FLO Customer Segmentation Project

This project was completed during the Miuul Data Science Bootcamp and aims to segment FLO customers based on their shopping behaviors, enabling more effective and personalized marketing strategies.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze FLO customer data collected from both online and offline channels (OmniChannel) between 2020 and 2021. Using **RFM analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)**, customers are grouped into meaningful segments for targeted marketing.

Key points:

- Analyze purchase behaviors to identify different customer segments.
- Score customers based on their purchasing recency, frequency, and monetary value.
- Assign customers to segments such as champions, loyal customers, at risk, etc.
- Identify special customer groups for specific marketing campaigns.
- Export target customer lists for specific marketing actions.

## 🔍 About the Analysis Methodology

RFM Analysis is a customer segmentation technique based on three metrics:

- **Recency**: How recently a customer made a purchase (lower is better)  
- **Frequency**: How often they purchase  
- **Monetary**: How much money they spend  

Customers are scored on each metric and grouped into segments such as champions, loyal customers, at risk, etc. This method helps target marketing campaigns more effectively by focusing on customer value and behavior patterns.
