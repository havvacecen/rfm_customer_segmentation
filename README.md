# FLO Customer Segmentation - Miuul Bootcamp

## Project Overview
This project aims to segment FLO customers based on their shopping behavior to create better marketing strategies. The dataset includes past purchases of customers who shopped both online and offline (OmniChannel) between 2020 and 2021. Using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis, customers are grouped into segments for more personalized communication and marketing.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project comes from the Miuul Bootcamp and contains customer purchase data from FLO, a popular shoe retailer. It includes variables such as customer ID, shopping channels, dates of first and last orders, total purchase counts, total spending, and interest in product categories over the last 12 months.

**Note:** The dataset cannot be shared publicly. To run the project, you need access to the original data provided by Miuul Bootcamp.

## Key Steps
